"""Demand counters for the generation-friction taxonomy.

Two pinned signals over model output:

* ``builtin_self_definitions`` -- the model writes ``fn NAME`` for a NAME
  the language already has. A model defining a function is a language
  telling you it lacks a name its users want, and it is a stronger signal
  than a failed call because the model paid to work around the gap.
* ``unresolved_calls`` -- plain-call sites for names the language does NOT
  have. This is the counter that must move to zero when a name is added.

MEASUREMENT RULE, and the reason this module exists rather than a regex in
a session that ends: count DISTINCT PROGRAMS, not raw occurrences. On the
G0 corpus, occurrence counts give qwen ``to_int`` = 291 and granite
``to_vec`` = 337; both collapse to ONE program under program counting --
the degenerate whole-program repetition the taxonomy discounts elsewhere.
Per-program counts are reported alongside every occurrence count so the
two can never be confused again.

DELIBERATELY TEXTUAL, NOT PARSE-BASED. These counters match against raw
source text with regexes; they do not call the parser. This is not an
oversight -- parse-gating would destroy the signal this module exists to
measure. Of the 6 programs carrying ``fn to_str`` in the G0 corpus, only
ONE parses cleanly: a model that defines a missing builtin is a model
already in trouble, so the programs carrying this signal are
overwhelmingly the ones that fail to parse. Gating on a successful parse
would report 1 definition in 1 program instead of 15 across 6 --
systematically discarding exactly the population the counter exists to
measure. (Corpus-wide the parse rate is 541/600 = 90.2%; on the
signal-carrying subset it is 1/6.) Contrast with ``eval/deformation.py``,
which does parse: its signature is a syntactic structure -- an
expression-statement whose expression is a ``==`` BinOp with a
FieldAccess LHS -- that only exists in a parsed AST. A bare name is not.

KNOWN LIMITATION. Because matching is textual, occurrences inside
comments and string literals are counted the same as genuine source use
-- ``fn to_str`` written in a comment, or the text ``to_int(`` sitting
inside a string literal, both match. The counts these functions return
are therefore upper bounds on genuine source occurrences, not exact
counts.
