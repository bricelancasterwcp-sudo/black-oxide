"""Drive the ownership probe across arms and seeds, resumably.

``eval.probe run`` takes ONE seed and runs every probe for ONE arm, so a
3-arm x 10-seed campaign is 30 invocations. This lives in the repo rather
than a scratch script for the reason the 6a pilot's demand table is now
permanently irreproducible: its filter existed only in a session that
ended.

RESUME. ``run_corpus`` appends one line per probe to
``probe_results.jsonl`` and deliberately RAISES if that file already
exists, so two runs cannot interleave in one file. This module works with
that guard rather than around it:

  * ``probe_summary.json`` is written only after every probe in a cell
    finishes -- its presence is the completion marker.
  * A cell with results but no summary died mid-cell: delete it and redo.
  * Worst case loses one cell (20 repairs), never the campaign.
