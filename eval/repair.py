"""Repair-prompt construction (SPEC Part X, section 6.3).

A repair prompt is the arm's own initial prompt with its tail swapped:
everything `harness.build_prompt` produces except the trailing output
contract, then the rejected program, then the failure block, then the
fix instruction. Reusing the frozen harness -- rather than
reconstructing a lead here -- is what makes context retention
structurally equal across arms instead of merely asserted.

`expected_stdout` is deliberately not a parameter, and
`harness.build_prompt` does not disclose it either. Disclosing it would
let a weak model pass by hard-coding a print of the expected string,
silently corrupting the headline metric.
