"""A ``ModelClient`` backed by llama.cpp's ``llama-server``.

Ollama cannot do this job. It accepts a ``grammar`` option and silently
ignores it, returning free text -- so a run that *looks* constrained is not,
and the whole point of constrained decoding (no OX0001/OX01xx, therefore
every remaining failure is semantic) would be lost with no visible symptom.
llama-server takes a top-level ``"grammar"`` string and enforces it.

Everything else mirrors :mod:`eval.models` deliberately: the same frozen
:class:`~eval.models.Generation`, the same sampling pins (section 48), the
same retry shape, and above all the same failure classification --
``ModelError`` means INFRASTRUCTURE and nothing else. A model that rambles,
truncates at ``num_predict``, or emits garbage is a *result*.

One asymmetry is forced by the backend and is the reason
:meth:`LlamaCppClient.preflight` exists: ``num_ctx`` is fixed when
llama-server starts (``-c``), not per request. It therefore cannot be
pinned in the request body the way Ollama's ``options.num_ctx`` is, and a
server started with a smaller window would truncate oversized prompts from
the FRONT -- dropping the language card from the oxide and explicit arms
only, exactly the silent non-random bias section 48 pins against. Preflight
refuses to run against such a server.

Stdlib only.
