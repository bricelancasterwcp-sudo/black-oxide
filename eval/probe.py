"""Ownership probe: prompt construction, scoring, and runner.

The whole-program instrument cannot reach linearity. `src/sema/analyze.py`
is strictly staged -- lexing, parsing, name resolution and type checking
all gate it -- so across ~530 Oxide-arm attempts in five Phase 6a
configurations no `OX04xx` diagnostic has ever fired. Small models never
clear the first two stages, grammar constraint moved the population to
the third, and frontier models clear all four and score 20/20. The
feature the language exists for is reached by nobody.

This instrument hands the model a program that is complete and correct
EXCEPT for one ownership defect, together with the compiler's own
diagnostic, and scores the repair. Everything that is not ownership --
syntax, names, types -- is supplied and correct, so the only thing the
model can get wrong is the thing under test.

`expected_stdout` is never disclosed, exactly as in `eval/repair.py`: a
model told the expected output could pass by printing it, silently
corrupting the headline metric.

Stdlib only. The corpus lives in `eval/probes.jsonl` and every record is
mechanically verified by `tests/test_probes.py`.
