    estimate, or by its ``ServerContextOverflowError`` subclass when the

    see ``eval.llamacpp``) is the one exception, and it is gated on
    EVIDENCE, not on which of the two raised it (SPEC section 45/51):

    - ``session.attempts >= 1`` (at least one attempt already submitted
      THIS session): a RESULT, not infrastructure. The estimate is
      deliberately crude (see ``eval.models.estimate_tokens``) and a
      repair prompt that grows across attempts can overflow either check

      truncation at ``num_predict``, which is already a result. The

    ``generate``; an API-backed client carrying ``max_tokens`` instead of
    ``num_predict`` would otherwise have '2048' recorded against it with
    total confidence. ``null`` is an honest 'unknown'.

    ``num_ctx`` and ``model_context_length`` are DIFFERENT numbers and are
    named so they cannot be confused. ``model_context_length`` is the
    model's advertised capability read off /api/tags (32768). ``num_ctx``
    is the window the run actually used -- pinned by the client, because
    Ollama's own default is 4096 and would silently truncate the Oxide
    arms' prompts from the front (section 48).

    ``grammar_sha256`` is recorded per arm (section 49): a result produced
    under a grammar cannot be traced without knowing which one, and the
    rust arm's is always ``None`` by design (it is never constrained).
    ``preflight`` is embedded alongside the fields already extracted from
    it, since llamacpp's payload carries provenance (e.g. ``model_path``)
    that has no equivalent top-level key here -- MINUS its own
    ``grammar_sha256``, when present. That key (``LlamaCppClient.
    preflight``'s own payload) reflects whichever client preflight was
    run against, which is always ``clients["rust"]`` -- never constrained
    -- so embedded verbatim it would read a permanently-``None`` grammar
    digest inside ``manifest["preflight"]`` on every run, constrained or
    not, sitting right next to the correctly-populated PER-ARM
    ``grammar_sha256`` two keys up. A reader who checks only the nested
    copy could misread a constrained run as unconstrained; dropped from
    the embedded copy so the top-level per-arm field is the one place
    this run's grammar provenance lives.
