"""Blind card-validation tests for Phase 5b (SPEC.md sections 42-43, third file).

Every fenced code block in LANGUAGE_CARD.md and LANGUAGE_CARD_EXPLICIT.md
must validate clean in its card's dialect: core-card blocks through
``src.codegen.rust.transpile``, explicit-card blocks through
``src.explicit.pipeline.run``. The pinned harness rule wraps non-main
blocks by prepending NOTHING (blocks are validated verbatim; codegen's
synthesized ``fn main() {}`` covers non-main modules), and blocks fenced
as ```text are exempt. The two cards' word counts must be within 10% of
each other (SPEC section 42 baselines the explicit card against the core
card), and the core card stays under 1100 words (raised from 900 -> 1000
by the v0.4 wave-1 card amendment, then 1000 -> 1100 by wave-2's — see
SPEC.md's dated amendment sections, §58 and §59).

Blind TDD: written against SPEC.md only; not executed by its author.

# six builtins (sort, min, max, sum, contains, unwrap_or) plus a
# shadowing sentence, moving the core card from 895 to 988 words. Limit
# raised 900 -> 1000 non-silently (see SPEC.md's v0.4 amendment) to keep
# working headroom without loosening the pin to the point of not pinning.
#
# v0.4 wave 2 (2026-08-28): the card gained a `count` builtin line and a
# compound-assignment (`+=`/`-=`/`*=`) sentence in Syntax essentials,
# moving the core card from 988 to 1059 words (988 tripped nothing; 1059
# exceeds the old 1000 pin). Limit raised 1000 -> 1100 non-silently (see
# SPEC.md's §59 amendment) for the same reason as wave 1: headroom
# without loosening the pin past the point of pinning anything.
